# Hi there, I'm Uzair Shafique üëã 

**Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer | Pharm.D Candidate Bridging Medicine & Technology**

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over 2 years of experience developing data-driven solutions in healthcare and across domains. With a background in pharmacy and expertise in AI, I integrate domain-specific insights with machine learning techniques to address practical challenges.

My work spans the complete machine learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment using tools such as Flask and Streamlit. I have experience optimizing ML/DL models for various computing environments, including CPU, GPU, and TPU setups.


##  What I Do

 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  Classification, forecasting, NLP, and Generative AI using `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, and `Hugging Face`.
 
 **NLP & Prompt Engineering**  Designing and deploying LLM-based solutions and fine-tuned transformer models.
 
**Data Analysis & Visualization**  Deriving insights using `Python`, `SQL`, `Excel`, and `Tableau`and other tools as well.

**Healthcare AI** Leveraging Pharmacy and healthcare knowledge to build predictive models for medical problems.

**Full-Stack ML Deployment**  Deploying ML apps using `Flask`, `Streamlit`, `Docker`, and `CI/CD`.

 **Web Development**  Building user-centric interfaces using `React.js`, `HTML/CSS`, and REST APIs.


##  Skills & Tools

**Languages & Libraries:**  
`Python`, `R`, `SQL`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Transformers`, `spaCy`, `e1071`, `caret`

**Visualization & Analysis:**  
`Excel`, `Tableau`, `ggplot2`

**Deployment & DevOps:**  
`Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Flask`, `Streamlit`, `CI/CD`, `Minikube`

**Frontend Development:**  
`React.js`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`

**Other:**  
`Linux`, `Git`, `Prompt Engineering`, `APIs`, `LLMs`
