# 👋 Hi, I’m Uzair Shafique

**Data Scientist & ML Engineer | Model Deployment & Product Thinking | Python, SQL, Data Analysis, Generative AI**

I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 2+ years of experience building end-to-end AI solutions from raw data to real-world deployment. With a background in pharmacy, I combine healthcare knowledge with technical expertise to solve real problems through data and ML.

My work spans the full machine learning lifecycle:
data cleaning → feature engineering → modeling → deployment using tools like Flask, Streamlit, and Docker. I’ve worked with structured and unstructured datasets in healthcare, public data, and operational domains, deploying models on both local and cloud setups (CPU, GPU, TPU).




##  What I Work On

**Machine Learning & Deep Learning** Classification, forecasting, NLP, and generative models using 'scikit-learn', 'TensorFlow', 'PyTorch', and 'Hugging Face'

**NLP & Prompt Engineering** Fine-tuning 'transformer models', 'building LLM apps', and designing 'custom prompts'

**Data Analysis & Visualization** Working with messy real-world data using 'Python', 'SQL', 'Excel',  to extract insights

**Healthcare AI** Building models for drug prediction, clinical data analysis, and real-world medical problems

**ML Deployment** Creating interactive dashboards and APIs using Flask, Streamlit, Docker, and CI/CD

**Web Development** Building user-facing tools and interfaces using 'React.js', 'HTML', 'CSS', and 'REST APIs'

**Languages & Libraries:**
'Python', 'R', 'SQL', 'NumPy', 'Pandas', 'scikit-learn', 'Keras', 'TensorFlow', 'PyTorch', 'Transformers', spaCy, 'e1071', 'caret'

**Visualization & Reporting:**
'Excel', 'Tableau', 'ggplot2', 'Matplotlib', 'Seaborn'

**Deployment & MLOps:**
'Flask', 'Streamlit', 'Docker', 'Kubernetes', 'CI/CD', 'Minikube', 'Postman'

**Frontend & Integration:**
'React.js', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'REST APIs'

**Other:**
'Linux', 'Git', 'Prompt Engineering', 'LLMs', 'APIs', 'Jupyter', 'VS Code'
